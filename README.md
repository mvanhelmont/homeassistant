Home Assistant Backup

I have a nice appartment in Amsterdam and love automation. So i started first with Domoticz. A great open source platform to learn how to auotmate my house. Later i switched to Home Assistant. 

My hardware:
- Milight Hub self build - https://github.com/sidoh/esp8266_milight_hub
- Meek P1 Gas/Elec Meter - https://www.meek-ha.com
  - This is a in development project and i test some products of it.
- RFLink Controller - For some old Clcik On Click Off switches
- 38 Milight RGBCTT Bulbs
- 1 Nanoleaf
- Amazon Alexa
- AppleTV

Everything is add in Home Assistant. I shared my configuration so you can learn from it.
ALso when you see improvements let me know... I still learning :D
