# homeassistant

This is my Home Assistant Github. Here i store my whole configuration files in case my system crash...

I have a nice apartment in Amsterdam and love automation. So i started first with Domoticz. A great open source platform to learn how to automate my house. Now i'm using Home Assistant. More powerful.

To edit my configuration i use ATOM https://atom.io. Can fetch, pull, push all my changes to Github. on HA Server i pull the new data back.
Working on all YAML scripts to add tags to it, so i can search in ATOM on tags. Must faster way to edit more YAML files.
